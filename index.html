                    ABOUT
                </h1>

                <p>
                    I love programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all began when I was a junior in high school. I was inspired by my favorite teacher at the time. He taught Physics, but would be teaching a robotics class I was interested in taking senior year. I decided to enroll in the class, despite the fact that I had no programming experience. So I began teaching myself C++ by way of videos on YouTube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It turned out the class only required basic programming knowledge in a C-based language, ROBOTC. I worked hard teaching myself all summer long, and when school finally began, I found that I was among the most advanced programmers in the class. I really enjoyed working with the Vex robots, and by the time the class ended, I was officially hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had also learned enough about C++ to build some simple games in my spare time. While they may not have been so technically advanced, I had fun building them. As a result, I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science. I was accepted to San Francisco State University where I continue to study to this day. If everything goes as planned, I will graduate in May, 2019. I hope to continue my education, and plan to earn a masters degree in computer science with an emphasis in cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am comfortable programming in C++, Java, C#, and JavaScript. I also have experience using the Unity3d game engine which I used to build the android game, Corginverse (Now available on the Google Play Store)!
                </p>
